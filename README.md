# Gestuer-Controlled-Car

This is kind of car that can be controlled by just hand gestures. This project has tremendous applications especially in health domain. For example, a person who is disabled and is on wheelchair can control his wheelchair just by using hand gestures. We know how dangerous it can be to meet a covid-19 positive patient. This project can be used there as well to open doors wirelessly, to supply food to patients through robot or robotic car just by using hand gestures.

HardwareComponent's Function

1. MPU-6050(x1): This is a 3-axis accelerometer(AX, AY, AZ) + 3 axis gyroscope module(GX, GY GZ). In this project we have only made use of accelerometer.
2. Chassis(x1): This is the body of the Robotic Car
3. Arduino Pro Mini (x2): This is the brain of the Transmitter as well as receiver. One Arduino is used for receiving the data while on the other hand one Arduino is used for Transmitting the data.
4. 433Mhz TX RX Module: This module will be used for transmitting and receiving the data from MPU-6050.
5. Other Necessary Components : Jumper Wires, Mini Breadboard, Wheels, Right hand Glove.
6. L298N: This is the Motor Driver to drive the motors of the Car.
